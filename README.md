# perf-demo
Perf-Demo is a simple web application that defines a set of RESTful web services containing common performance issues. There are two versions of each service. Version 1 contains the performance issue and version 2 implements the same service with the performance issue resolved.

The project currently contains the following performance issues:

1. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Processing
2. Memory Leaks
3. N+1 Database Query Issue

The project is to be used in an upcoming performance podcast demonstrating deployment of an application via AWS CodePipeline and utilizing Dynatrace AppMon and Apica LoadTest. Additional information on the podcast can be found here (TBD).
