# perf-demo
Perf-Demo is a simple web application that defines a set of RESTful web services containing various performance issues. There are multiple versions of each service. One version contains the performance issue and another implements the same service with the performance issue resolved.

The project currently contains the following performance issues:

1. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Processing
2. Out of Memory Errors
3. N+1 Query Issue

The project is to be used in an upcoming performance podcast demonstrating deployment of an application via AWS CodePipeline and utilizing Dynatrace AppMon and Apica LoadTest. Additional information on the podcast can be found here (TBD).
